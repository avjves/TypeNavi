# TypeNavi
Software to navigate desktop using just the keyboard.

Works by taking a screenshot of the current screen and runs it through a OCR engine to get all words and their locations. User inputs a search word, which is then highlighted on screen and pressing enter will then quick said word.

MVP - Works, but missing lots of functionality.

## Issues
Current OCR technology is not fast / accurate enough for this to be fluid enough.
