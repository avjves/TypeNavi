## Keyboard Navigation

Used to navigate the desktop with just keyboard.
ALT + R takes a screenshot of current active window, then starts a new UI window for user to type what the want.
The picture goes through a fast OCR software to get all the texts and their positions currently on screen. It then fuzzily matches the user inputted text to any text on screen. Current "selection" will be highlighted and and user can press it by pressing ENTER.
